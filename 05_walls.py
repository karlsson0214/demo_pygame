'''
Demo collision detection between a bird and a box

Tasks:

1. Make it possible for the bird to move in all directions.
2. Make is impossible for the bird to move outside the screen.
3. Check that the box goes red when it collides with the bird.
4. Make it impossible for the bird do move into the box. 
   Hint: Move the bird back to its previous position.
5. Add a second box to the game.
6. Make it impossible for the bird to move into the second box.
7. Which changes do you need to make if you want to add another ten boxes to the game?
